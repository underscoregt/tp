## Quick start

This quick start assumes you are a teacher who wants to install CPP, open the application, and run a few common commands to manage your contacts, classes, and assignments. Follow the short steps below, then consult [**Features**](#features) for full command details.

### Prerequisites

* Minimum disk space: `500 MB` for app + data. Please refer to the section on [**How to check available disk space**](#how-to-check-available-disk-space) to ensure you have enough free space.

* Java 17 or newer must be installed and available on your PATH. Please refer to the section on [**How to check and install Java**](#how-to-check-and-install-java) to check your Java version and install Java if needed.

#### How to check available disk space

<box type="info">As a reference, 1 TB = 1048576 MB, 1 GB = 1024 MB.</box>

**Windows:**

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to **"This PC"** or **"My Computer"**.

1. Look for the drive where you plan to store the app home (e.g., `C:\` or `D:\`).

1. Check the **"Free space"** column for that drive to ensure it has at least `500MB` free.

1. If you have enough free space, you may proceed to check the Java version as described in the next section [**How to check and install Java**](#how-to-check-and-install-java).

**macOS:**

1. Click on the Apple menu and select "About This Mac".

1. Go to the "Storage" tab.

1. Check the available space for the drive where you plan to store the app home (e.g., Macintosh HD) to ensure it has at least `500MB` free.

1. If you have enough free space, you may proceed to check the Java version as described in the next section [**How to check and install Java**](#how-to-check-and-install-java).

#### How to check and install Java

**Windows:**

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell by searching for it in the Windows Search Bar.

1. To check Java from Command Prompt or PowerShell, run `java -version`.

1. If Java is installed, you should see output showing the Java version (e.g., `java version "17.0.1"`).
    <box type="info">Any version that is 17.0.0 or newer is acceptable.</box>
    <box type="warning">Older versions (e.g., Java 8) will not work and must be updated using Step 4.</box>
    <box type="warning">If you see an error like 'java' is not recognized, it means Java is not installed. Please follow Step 4 to install Java.</box>

    ![Windows Java Version](images/java-version-windows.png)

1. If Java is not found, you may refer to the [Windows guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html) to install Java 17.

1. Once Java is installed, repeat Steps 1-3 to verify the installation.

**macOS:**

1. Open Terminal by searching for it in the Applications folder or using Mac's Spotlight.

1. To check Java from Terminal, run `java -version`.

1. If Java is installed, you should see output showing the Java version (e.g., `java version "17.0.1"`).
    <box type="info">Any version that is 17.0.0 or newer is acceptable.</box>
    <box type="warning">Older versions (e.g., Java 8) will not work and must be updated using Step 4.</box>
    <box type="warning">If you see an error like "bash: java: command not found", it means Java is not installed. Please follow Step 4 to install Java.</box>

    ![macOS Java Version](images/java-version-mac.png)
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">(Source: tutorials24x7)</p>

1. If Java is not found, you may refer to the [macOS guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to install Java 17.

1. Once Java is installed, repeat Steps 1-3 to verify the installation.

### Install and run

1. Download the latest `cpp.jar` from the project [release page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/releases).

1. Move it to a folder that you will use as the app home.
    <box type="info">A subfolder "data/" and a file "preferences.json" will both be created in this folder.</box>

1. Users are **strongly encouraged to create a dedicated folder for CPP** (e.g., `Documents/CPP`) rather than running the `cpp.jar` file from a temporary download folder to prevent the accidental deletion of data files.

1. Open the folder where you saved `cpp.jar`, right click on an empty space in the folder and select **"Open in Terminal" (macOS)** or **"Open Command Prompt here" (Windows)**.
   <box type="info">On later versions of Windows, you may also see "Open in Terminal" which is also fine.</box>

1. To launch the app, type in the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    java -jar cpp.jar
    ```

\
Within a few seconds the application will appear. The main User Interface (UI) contains from top to bottom:

* A command box to enter CLI commands.

* A result display that shows the output of commands and brief success/error messages.

* A central list panel with a toggle to show contacts, classes, or assignments.

    <box type="info">The app will automatically load some default contacts on first launch.</box>

### Quick CLI tutorial (common tasks and expected output)

#### Tips

<box type="tip" seamless>

* Do not attempt to copy multiple commands at once. Copy and paste one command at a time, and wait for the result display to show the confirmation message before pasting the next command.

* Use `help` in the command box for a quick list of commands: `help`.

* If you are unsure of the command format, you may enter the command with incomplete parameters (e.g., `addcontact n/John Doe`) and the app will show an error message with the correct usage.

</box>

* **List all contacts:**

    Command:

    ```text
    list contacts
    ```

    Expected: Displays a numbered list of contacts in the main panel.

    ```text
    Listed all contacts
    ```

* **Add a contact John Doe with phone, email, address and tags:**

    Command:

    ```text
    addcontact n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2 t/TransferStudent t/FinancialAid
    ```

    Expected: Confirmation message in result display and new contact appears in the list.

    ```text
    New contact added: John Doe; Phone: 98765432; Email: johnd@example.com; Address: 311, Clementi Ave 2; Tags: [TransferStudent][FinancialAid]
    ```

* **Delete the 1st, 2nd and 3rd contact in the list:**

    Command:

    ```text
    delete ct/1 2 3
    ```

    Expected: Confirmation message in result display and contact list updated with the deleted contact removed.

    ```text
    Deleted Contact: Alice Yeoh; Phone: 87438807; Email: alexyeoh@example.com; Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40; Tags: [friends]
    Deleted Contact: Bernice Yu; Phone: 99272758; Email: berniceyu@example.com; Address: Blk 30 Lorong 3 Serangoon Gardens, #07-18; Tags: [colleagues][friends]
    Deleted Contact: Charlotte Oliveiro; Phone: 93210283; Email: charlotte@example.com; Address: Blk 11 Ang Mo Kio Street 74, #11-04; Tags: [neighbours]
    ```

* **Find by name keywords (case-insensitive):**

    Command:

    ```text
    findcontact dAviD IRFAN
    ```

    Expected: Confirmation message in result display and contact list updated to show only David Li and Irfan Ibrahim.

    ```text
    2 contacts listed!
    ```

#### Warnings and expected failures

<box type="warning" seamless>

* Back up your data folder (`data/addressbook.json`) before manual edits. A corrupted `addressbook.json` will cause the app to start with an empty dataset.

* The app prevents obvious duplicates at entry; if you attempt to add contacts, assignments, or classes with the same name, CPP will reject the entry with an explanatory error.

</box>

Refer to the [**Features**](#features) below for advanced features with the full command format, options and advanced examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addcontact n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addcontact n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]...` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.<br>
  e.g. `ct/CONTACT_INDICES...` can be used as `ct/1`, `ct/1 2 3`, `ct/1 3 5 7` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`

* Only the name is searched.

* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`

* Contacts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).<br>
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

</box>

Examples:

* `addclass c/CS2103T-T10-1`<br>
  Creates a class with the name "CS2103T-T10-1".

* `list contacts` followed by `addclass c/CS2103T-T10-1 ct/1 2 3`<br>
  Creates a class with the name "CS2103T-T10-1" allocated to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd contacts.

### Allocating classes to contacts: `allocclass`

* If any of the parameters are invalid, the command will also fail and no allocation is done.

* The contact indices specified refer to the currently displayed contact list after filtering (e.g., after a `find` command). It is recommended to run `list contacts` before this command to ensure the correct contact indices are used.

* Reallocating a class to a contact that already belongs to that class will not cause any changes to the contact's class memberships. However, if no successful allocations are performed at the end of the command, the command will fail and the user will see an error message specifying the issue.

</box>

Examples:

* `list contacts` followed by `allocass c/CS2103T-T10-1 ct/1`<br>
  Allocates the class "CS2103T-T10-1" to only the 1st contact in the list.

* Unallocating a class from a contact that does not belong to that class will not cause any changes to the contact's class memberships. However, if no successful unallocations are performed at the end of the command, the command will fail and the user will see an error message specifying the issue.

</box>

Examples:

* `list contacts` followed by `unallocass c/CS2103T-T10-1 ct/1`<br>
  Unallocates the class "CS2103T-T10-1" from only the 1st contact in the list.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data is saved automatically in `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?\
**A**: Install CPP on the other computer by following the installation instructions in [**Install and run**](#install-and-run), then copy the `data/addressbook.json` file from your existing app home folder into the new app home folder by overwriting the empty file created on first run. Always stop the app before copying files.

**Q**: How can I back up my data and restore it if something goes wrong?\
**A**: Make a copy of `data/addressbook.json` and store it in a safe location such as a cloud or external drive. To restore, stop CPP, replace the `addressbook.json` in the app home `data/` folder, then start CPP.

**Q**: How does CPP prevent duplicate entries?\
**A**: CPP performs basic duplicate detection at entry. **For contacts, classes and assignments**, the **name** should be unique. No 2 contacts, classes nor assignments should share the same name. If you attempt to add a contact, class or assignment that violates these rules, CPP will reject the entry and show an error message.

**Q**: Can I export/import data for other systems (e.g., Excel)?\
**A**: The primary data format used by CPP is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). We do not support importing from Excel, but users may manually convert their Excel files to JSON format, adhering to the structure and format of the `addressbook.json` file generated on first run. Manual editing of `addressbook.json` is not recommended unless you are comfortable with JSON.

## Known issues and workarounds

1. **Multiple screens / off-screen window**: If you move the app to a secondary monitor and later use only the primary monitor, the GUI may open off-screen.<br>
   Workaround: delete `preferences.json` in the app home folder while the app is closed; the window position will reset on next start.

1. **Minimized Help Window**: If the Help Window is minimized and you run `help` again, the existing window may remain minimized.<br>
   Workaround: restore it manually from the taskbar.

1. **Preferences or data corruption**: If `preferences.json` or `addressbook.json` becomes invalid (e.g., partial writes), CPP will start with an empty dataset.<br>
   Workaround: Always keep backups before making changes.

1. **File permission issues (Windows)**: Running the app from a protected folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files`) may prevent writing `data/` or `preferences.json`.<br>
   Workaround: Run from a user-writable folder (e.g., Documents) or run the terminal as Administrator.

If you encounter other issues, please raise a ticket with the project maintainers and include `data/addressbook.json` and `preferences.json` for troubleshooting.
